       <p><strong>Flower</strong>A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom,is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Angiospermae).

        <ol type="A">

            <ul>
                <li>The calyx: the outermost whorl consisting of units called sepals. These are often green and enclose the rest of the flower in the bud. They may be absent, or they may be petal-like in some species</li>
                <li>The corolla: the petals, usually thin, soft and often colored to attract animals that help pollination </li>
            </ul>
            <li>The reproductive parts:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The androecium, the male part, is the stamens</li>
