Lab 2: Buttons, Border, Color and Pseudo class.

<button>: The Button element
The <button> HTML element is an interactive element activated by a user with a mouse, keyboard, finger, voice command, or other assistive technology. Once activated, it then performs a programmable action, such as submitting a form or opening a dialog.
By default, HTML buttons are presented in a style resembling the platform the user agent runs on, but you can change buttons' appearance with CSS.

Pseudo Class:
A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.
For example, it can be used to:
i)   Style an element when a user mouses over it
ii)  Style visited and unvisited links differently
iii) Style an element when it gets focus

CSS Padding
The CSS padding properties are used to generate space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.
With CSS, you have full control over the padding. There are properties for setting the padding for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).
CSS has properties for specifying the padding for each side of an element:
1) padding-top
2) padding-right
2) padding-bottom
4) padding-left
All the padding properties can have the following values:
length - specifies a padding in px, pt, cm, etc.
% - specifies a padding in % of the width of the containing element
inherit - specifies that the padding should be inherited from the parent element
